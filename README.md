## :package: Prerequisites

- [Python 3.11+](https://docs.python.org/3/) for development.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for build system.
- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs) for container packaging.
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for git management.

## :sparkles: Features

- Ability to share terraform configuration without modules.
- Ability to define arbitrary resource layout.
- Ability to auto-generate documentation using metadata attached to resource definition.
- Ability to execute runbooks to interact with resources.
- Ability to import variables between resource group.

## :dart: Motivation

- We needed a way to manage resources as code at scale.
- The solution should leverage terraform to avoid re-implementing the wheel.
- The solution shouldn't leverage the terraform configuration DSL to add features since it can change.

## :hammer: Workflow

### Setup

The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. Clone repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/elastic/terranova
   cd terranova
   ```
2. Use version defined in .python-version:
   ```shell
   pyenv install
   ```
3. Install dependencies and setup environment:
   ```shell
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   poetry poe env:configure
   ```

### Lint

- To lint you have to use the workflow.

```bash
poetry poe lint
```

- It will lint the project code using `pylint`.

### Format

- To format you have to use the workflow.

```bash
poetry poe fmt
```

- It will format the project code using `black` and `isort`.

## ðŸ“– Usage

### How to install it

```bash
# For MacOSX Apple Silicon

# For Linux arm64
gh release download 0.2.0 -p '*-linux-arm64' -O /usr/local/bin/terranova --clobber

# For Linux amd64
gh release download 0.2.0 -p '*-linux-amd64' -O /usr/local/bin/terranova --clobber

# Make it executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/terranova
```

### Define an arbitrary resource layout

- `terranova` rely on the concept of resource groups.
- You can define as many resource groups as you want.
- The base layout should contain the directory `resources` and `shared`.
- The `resources` directory contains resource groups.
- The `shared` directory contains any sharable resource that will be symlink if defined as dependency.
- A resource group is defined when a `manifest.yml` is present.
- By default, `terranova` will look for a `conf` directory in the working directory that contain both above directories.

```
conf
â”œâ”€â”€ resources
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resource_group_1
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ runbooks
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pyinfra.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ manifest.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resource_group_2
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ manifest.yml
â””â”€â”€ shared
    â”œâ”€â”€ providers
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ github.tf
    â””â”€â”€ config.tf
```

- `terranova` will rely on the layout to apply change using terraform.
- In the above case, running `terranova apply resource_group_1` will run `terraform` on resources present in that directory.
- `terranova` supports any depth within the layout.
- This allows you to reflect any structure.

### How to get start

- Create a new directory in `conf/resources`.
- Create a new `manifest.yml` file with the following content.

```yaml
version: "1.2"

metadata:
  name: Terranova Hello World
  description: Hello World
  url: https://github.com/elastic/terranova
  contact: mailto:adrien.mannocci@elastic.co
```

- Define any resource using standard `terraform` configuration.
- Add metadata on each resource to allow auto-generate documentation.

```terraform
/*
@attr-name attr-value
*/
resource "null_resource" "foobar" {}
```

- You can now run `terranova init <resource_group_name>` and `terranova apply <resource_group_name>`.

### How to define shared dependencies.

- In some case, we need to share common terraform configuration or scripts across many resource group.
- It's possible to define dependencies in the manifest and symlink them in any resource group.
- Those common resources should be defined in the `shared` directory.
- All symlink are maintained by `terranova` and are updated when the `terranova init` command is run.

```yaml
# Supported since 1.0 manifest version.
---
dependencies:
  - source: providers/github.tf # Which file or directory to symlink.
    target: 00-github-provider.tf # Where to symlink the file or directory.
```

### How to define runbook.

- In some case, we need to interact with terraform resources using specific tooling.
- It's possible to define a runbook in the manifest and invoke arbitrary tools.
- It's also possible to interact with `terranova` to extract information using [`outputs`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs).

```yaml
# Supported since 1.1 manifest version.
---
runbooks:
  - name: "<runbook_name>" # Used as argument in the command
    entrypoint: "<tool_entrypoint>" # Tool to invoke
    workdir: "<working_directory>" # Optional: Used to navigate in sub-directories.
    args:
      - <arguments> # List of arguments to pass
    env:
      - name: PATH # Inherit environment value
      - name: FOO # Override or define environment value
        value: bar
```

### How to import variables across resource groups.

- In some case, we need to interact across many resource groups and need to import variables from a resource group to another one.
- It's possible to define imports in the manifest.

```yaml
# Supported since 1.2 manifest version.
---
imports:
  - from: "<resource_group_path>" # Relative resource group path
    import: "<output_variable>" # Name of the output variable to import
    as: "<working_directory>" # Optional: Name of the input variable to map to.
```

### How to regenerate the documentation.

- Run the following command `terranova docs`.

### How to apply configuration changes.

- Run the following command `terranova apply <path>`.

### How to import a resource.

- Run the following command `terranova import <path> <resource_address> <identifier>`.
- The [`import`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import) terraform command is used under the hood.
